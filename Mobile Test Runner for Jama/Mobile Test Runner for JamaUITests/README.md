# User Interface Tests

Mobile Test Runner for Jama UI tests were built using Test Driven Development when possible.  Other tests were created using the Xcode UI test recorder. In the folder: ViewControllerUITests you will find all of the UI test code used throughout development.


## Running tests
These tests can be run by hitting command+U within Xcode, or by selecting Product/Test from the dropdown menu.
